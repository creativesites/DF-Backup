# Allio Dialogflow

## Description
Has all Dialogflow Puppeteer scripts. All scripts are named according to function. This repo has scripts for:

* Creating Agents
* Updating Intents
* Updating Entities
* Getting Logs by Dates
* Getting Logs (generic)
* Backing Up Agents (index.js)
* Getting Parameters from the Welcome intent

These scrips are best run using AWS Workspaces Windows instance.
The scripts are generally set to be run manually, given the high level of puppeteer browser errors and Dialogflow's use of dynamic classes.
